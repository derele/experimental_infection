The parasite was originally endemic to East Asia, but has transferred from its native host, the Japanese eel, Anguilla japonica Temminck \& Schlegel, to the European eel, Anguilla anguilla {(L.)} and American eel, Anguilla rostrata {(Le} Seur). Anguillicola crassus is a very successful colonizer and is now known to occur in four continents {(Asia,} Europe, Africa and America). The nematode can severely impair swimbladder function and has caused mortalities in both farmed and wild populations in the presence of other stressors. Anguillicola crassus may impair the capacity of European eels to complete the spawning migration, although direct evidence is not available to support this hypothesis. Areas for future research are recommended.},

parasitic lifestyle and numerous parasites have
recently expanded their distribution and host ranges
due to anthropogenic activities. Here, we report on
the population genetic structure of the invasive
nematode Anguillicola crassus, a parasite in
freshwater eels, which recently spread from Asia to
Europe and North America. Samples were collected
from the newly colonized na\"{i}ve host species
Anguilla anguilla {(Europe)} and Anguilla rostrata
{(North} America), and from indigenous Anguilla
japonica in Taiwan and Japan. Using seven
microsatellite loci and one mitochondrial marker, we
show that the parasite's population structure in
Europe mirrors the zoogeographic {Boreal-Lusitanian}
break along the English Channel. Both the
north-to-south decline of nuclear allelic diversity
and the loss of private alleles in the same
direction are consistent with a significant
isolation-by-distance pattern based on {rho(ST)}
values. In combination with the specific topology of
the distance tree among nematode populations, our
data suggest that Europe was invaded only once from
Taiwan, and that subsequently, genetic diversity was
lost due to random drift. On the contrary, the North
American sample shares distinct nuclear and
mitochondrial signatures with Japanese specimens. We
propose that the genetic structure in Europe was
shaped by long-range anthropogenic eel host
transfers in the north and a single dispersal event
into the southwest. The genetically distinct
Brittany sample at the edge of the
{Boreal-Lusitanian} boundary is indicative of
natural dispersal of fish hosts since recruitment
occurs naturally there and invertebrate host
dissemination is interrupted due to oceanic
currents.},

In subadult eels, prevalence of adult and juvenile stages combined ranged from 13\% to 82\%; mean intensity ranged from 2.6 to 9.0 worms per eel. Infection levels were highest for Susquehanna River eels (northernmost river) and lowest in the southernmost sites: St. Jerome's Creek and the Pocomoke River. Although eels from these 2 localities were larger, the low infection rates there are most likely due to reduced transmission in higher salinity water and not to eel size. Eels with both adult and juvenile stages of A. crassus were more common than expected by chance. This might be explained by inhibition of juveniles migrating into the swimbladder lumen when adults are already present there.},

abstract = {Abstract  Eel populations from the small rivers on the Island of Reunion {(French} Overseas Department in the Indian Ocean) were investigated with respect to the occurrence and abundance of helminths during the autumn of 2005. The native species Anguilla marmorata (n = 80), Anguilla bicolor (n = 23), and Anguilla mossambica (n = 15) were studied. Six species of helminths were identified, four of them having a definitely nonnative status. Furthermore, unidentified intra-intestinal juvenile cestodes and extra-intestinal encapsulated anisakid nematode larvae were present in a few eels. We found that the invasive swim bladder nematode Anguillicoloides {(Anguillicola)} crassus had been introduced into the island. Six specimens were collected, four from A. marmorata, one from A. bicolor and one from A. mossambica. The maximum intensity of infection was two worms. The other helminths also showed a low abundance. These species were the monogenean gill worms Pseudodactylogyrus anguillae and Pseudodactylogyrus bini and the intestinal parasites Bothriocephalus claviceps {(Cestodes),} Paraquimperia africana {(Nematodes),} and the acanthocephalan Acanthocephalus reunionensis Warner, Sasal, and Taraschewski, 2007. The latter species, found as intra-intestinal immatures, is thought to utilize amphibians as required hosts; its status, introduced or native, could not be determined. P. africana was described from A. mossambica in South Africa and has not been recorded outside Africa. The other species are known from populations of European and American eels. However, A. crassus and the two Pseudodactylogyrus species originate from East Asia, where they are indigenous parasites of Anguilla japonica. Both an assignment test based on seven specific microsatellite loci and subsequent sequencing of mitochondrial haplotypes of a partial fragment of cytochrome c oxidase 1 strongly suggest that the A. crassus may originated around the Baltic Sea. According to the results presented here, populations of the indigenous eel species from Reunion can be considered to harbor extremely isolationist alien parasite communities. Our findings support the hypothesis that during the present time of global biological change, invasion by a nonnative species into a target island is more likely to reflect the political affiliation of the colonized environment and the pathways of trade and tourism than geographic proximity between donor and recipient areas or other natural circumstances.},

Reinfected eels were killed and examined on Day 112.

The mean percentage of A. crassus recovered from eel swimbladders ranged from 14 to 20\% on Day 56 and from 9 to 26\% on Day 112. There was no significant relation between the proportion of recovered parasites and the primary and/or secondary infection dose. Furthermore, the higher the dose, the more severe were the haemorrhages and pigment spots seen in the swimbladder. Reinfected eels had significantly more severely thickened swimbladders, haemorrhages in the swimbladders and congestion of blood vessels in the swimbladders. Results of the {ELISA} showed that the eels developed no detectable antibody response against A. crassus.

abstract = {Over the past decades, various free-living animals (hosts) and their parasites have invaded recipient areas in which they had not previously occurred, thus gaining the status of aliens or exotics. In general this happened to a low extent for hundreds of years. With variable frequency, invasions have been followed by the dispersal and establishment of non-indigenous species, whether host or parasite. In the literature thus far, colonizations by both hosts and parasites have not been treated and reviewed together, although both are usually interwoven in various ways. As to those factors permitting invasive success and colonization strength, various hypotheses have been put forward depending on the scientific background of respective authors and on the conspicuousness of certain invasions. Researchers who have tried to analyse characteristic developmental patterns, the speed of dispersal or the degree of genetic divergence in populations of alien species have come to different conclusions. Among parasitologists, the applied aspects of parasite invasions, such as the negative effects on economically important hosts, have long been at the centre of interest. In this contribution, invasions by hosts as well as parasites are considered comparatively, revealing many similarities and a few differences. Two helminths, the liver fluke, Fasciola hepatica, of cattle and sheep and the swimbladder nematode, Anguillicola crassus, of eels are shown to be useful as model parasites for the study of animal invasions and environmental global change. Introductions of F. hepatica have been associated with imports of cattle or other grazing animals. In various target areas, susceptible lymnaeid snails serving as intermediate hosts were either naturally present and/or were introduced from the donor continent of the parasite {(Europe)} and/or from other regions which were not within the original range of the parasite, partly reflecting progressive stages of a global biota change. In several introduced areas, F. hepatica co-occurs with native or exotic populations of the congeneric F. gigantica, with thus far unknown implications. Over the fluke's extended range, in addition to domestic stock animals, wild native or naturalized mammals can also serve as final hosts. Indigenous and displaced populations of F. hepatica, however, have not yet been studied comparatively from an evolutionary perspective. A. crassus, from the Far East, has invaded three continents, without the previous naturalization of its natural host Anguilla japonica, by switching to the respective indigenous eel species. Local entomostrac crustaceans serve as susceptible intermediate hosts. The novel final hosts turned out to be naive in respect to the introduced nematode with far reaching consequences for the parasite's morphology (size), abundance and pathogenicity. Comparative infection experiments with Japanese and European eels yielded many differences in the hosts' immune defence, mirroring coevolution versus an abrupt host switch associated with the introduction of the helminth. In other associations of native hosts and invasive parasites, the elevated pathogenicity of the parasite seems to result from other deficiencies such as a lack of anti-parasitic behaviour of the na\"{i}ve host compared to the donor host which displays distinct behavioural patterns, keeping the abundance of the parasite low. From the small amount of available literature, it can be concluded that the adaptation of certain populations of the novel host to the alien parasite takes several decades to a century or more. Summarizing all we know about hosts and parasites as aliens, tentative patterns and principles can be figured out, but individual case studies teach us that generalizations should be avoided.},

After A. crassus was introduced to Europe, it became a predominant parasite of the European eel {(Anguilla} anguilla). A study performed with experimentally infected eels (98 days, 23 degrees C) revealed significant differences in the susceptibility of the two eel species to this parasite. The recovery rate of 30 administered infective A. crassus larvae {(L3)} from A. japonica was less than half of that from A. anguilla (33.2\% and 13.8\%, respectively). Almost 60\% of the worms recovered from A. japonica were found as dead, encapsulated and necrotic larvae in the swimbladder wall. In contrast, no dead larvae were found in A. anguilla. Additionally, the development of the worms was shown to be significantly slower in A. japonica compared with A. anguilla. The lower survival rate of the worms, together with their slower development, resulted in a significantly lower adult worm burden (11 and 428 mg wet weight, respectively) and in a decreased reproductive success in A. japonica compared with A. anguilla. These results demonstrate that the original host, A. japonica, possesses more effective defence mechanisms against A. crassus than does the non-adapted host, A. anguilla.},

broadly to include viruses, bacteria, protozoans and
helminths) may influence the numerical magnitude or
geographical distribution of their host populations;
most of such studies focus on the population biology

taking no explicit account of the genetics. Other
researchers have explored the possibility that the
coevolution of hosts and parasites may be
responsible for much of the genetic diversity found
in natural populations, and may even be the main
reason for sexual reproduction; such genetic studies
rarely take accurate account of the density-and
frequency-dependent effects associated with the
transmission and maintenance of parasitic
infections. This paper aims to combine epidemiology
and genetics, reviewing the way in which earlier
studies fit into a wider scheme and offering some
new ideas about host-parasite coevolution. One
central conclusion is that `successful' parasites
need not necessarily evolve to be harmless: both
theory and some empirical evidence (particularly
from the myxoma-rabbit system) indicate that many
coevolutionary paths are possible, depending on the
relation between virulence and transmissibility of
the parasite or pathogen.},

abstract = {The humoral immune response in the two eel species, Anguilla japonica and Anguilla anguilla against two fractions of antigens in Anguillicola crassus were {studied.Within} species, both eel species showed significantly elevated titres compared with controls when immunized with antigens from Anguillicola {crassus.In} interspecific comparison, Anguilla japonicashowed significantly elevated titres in comparison with Anguilla anguilla. Immunization of Anguilla anguillacaused a significantly decrease in the plasma levels of protein in comparison with control fish and all groups of Anguilla japonica. In contrast, Anguilla japonica showed significantly lower plasma levels of Ig in all groups compared with Anguilla {anguilla.The} different susceptibilities to Anguillicola crassus between the natural host, Anguilla japonica, and the na{\i}{\textasciidieresis}ve, Anguilla anguilla, is partly due to differences in the ability of the two eel species to mount a humoral immune response.},

abstract = {The original host of the swimbladder nematode Anguillicola crassus, the Japanese eel {(Anguilla} japonica) and the recently colonized European eel {(Anguilla} anguilla) were immunized with 40 irradiated (500 Gy) 3rd-stage larvae {(L3)} of this parasite and challenged with an infection of 40 normal L3. The immunization induced a significant reduction of the number of adult worms developing from the challenge infection in A. japonica, but not in A. anguilla. The induced resistance (calculated using the relation of the number of adult worms in immunized eels and in non-immunized control eels) in A. japonica was 87.3\%+/-30.4\%. Following a single infection, the percentage of adult worms found in A. japonica was lower as compared to A. anguilla, and the few adult worms were much smaller, revealing a lower susceptibility of A. japonica to A. crassus in comparison to A. anguilla. Both eel species developed an antibody response against A. crassus, but the level of antibody responses was not positively correlated with the protection against infection, suggesting that the antibody response is not a key element in resistance of eels against A. crassus. This study suggests that the original host of A. crassus is able to mount efficient protective immune responses against its parasite, whereas the newly acquired host seems to lack this ability.},

abstract = {The swimbladder nematode Anguillicola crassus originates from Asia where it is a parasite of the Japanese eel Anguilla japonica. After its introduction to Europe about 25 years ago, the parasite spread rapidly within the indigenous populations of the European eel Anguilla anguilla and subsequently the prevalence and mean intensity appeared to stabilize. Under experimental and aquaculture conditions the na\"{i}ve new host appears to be more susceptible to A. crassus compared to the original host. Both eel species develop a immune response against A. crassus. The antibody response is well characterized for the European eel, but poorly characterized for the Japanese eel. It remains unclear if antibodies have any protective function against A. crassus. Encapsulation of larvae of A. crassus can be observed in naturally infected European eels. However, encapsulation of larvae following experimental infection has not been detected in European eels, but only in Japanese eels. Reinfection experiments and intraperitoneal injection of A. crassus homogenates failed to demonstrate the development of acquired immunity in European eels. Immunization with irradiated third stage larvae provided preliminary evidence for acquired immunity against A. crassus in the Japanese eel, but not in the European eel.},
